## Description of the App
### Purpose: 
The purpose of the terminal app we created known as Bestnotes, is to provide as a note-taking app for everyone. Taking notes is a very important part of a person's life as it helps you to keep a permanent record of what you choose to type/write.

### Functionality:
We created the Bestnotes app for a variety of reasons:
When you’re reading and/or listening, note-taking helps you to concentrate and thus makes your learning more effective.
Notes are an important part of a students life. It’s useful for students who have upcoming assessments and examinations.

- Register for accounts with or without a password
- Once you are logged in, you can create and delete categories
- Once you have selected a category, you can add, update and delete notes. You can also generate a pdf containing all of the notes in that category.

### Instructions for Use:
ruby bestnotes.rb

## Future Enhancements:
There are a number of future enhancements we would like to make to the app, but due to the complexity of the enhancements as well as the lack of time to implement these enhancements, unfortunately we could not complete them. These future enhancements are:
- Being able to add storage to the app, thus allowing the user to save notes.
- Being able to completely delete a category with all the notes in it
- To beautify our app by formatting it in a better way
- For the user to be able to change the passwords after and/or before logging in.
- To be able to update the files as soon as changes to categories/notes are implemented,
- For multiple users to be able to share notes as well as edit/delete one another’s notes and/or categories.
- For the notes to have a due date.
- For the user to view notes with due dates in a calendar like view.
- For the user to archive notes so that they aren’t displayed in the main review but can be recovered, unlike deletions.




## Accessibility Concerns:
There are a few accessibility concerns regarding our app. These accessibility concerns are:
 The language barrier, as the menu options are only in English.
Due to our app being a note-taking app using an electronic device with no audio, the app may be inaccessible/difficult for people with disabilities such as: blindness, low-vision and colour-blindness.

### Solutions to these accessibility concerns:
When opening the bestnotes app, we can create an option which says “Select a language” with the flags of multiple languages displayed. This option will also be a future enhancement and will erase the language barrier.
A few ways we will deal with the inaccessibility of our app towards people with blindness, low-vision and colour-blindness are:
By becoming aware of accessibility concerns and implementing accessibility and ensuring our content can be accessed by a larger population.
Making sure to content is clearly written and easy to read, providing headers for notes and making sure that we don’t rely on colour alone to convey meaning.


## Potential legal, moral, ethical, cultural and safety issues:
Legal Issue:- If we want schools to use our Bestnotes app, then we must make sure that we abide by the law. According to a certain study, 15% of the world’s population experience some form of disabilities. Although not all of these people have disabilities that make it difficult for them to access Bestnotes, it’s still a significant portion of the population. For institutions such as schools and universities, it would violate the law.

### Moral Issue:
- Within our future enhancements, we stated that we want multiple users to be able to share notes as well as edit/delete one another’s notes and/or categories. This future enhancement can be a moral issue because sharing notes with multiple users may cause cyber-bullying. 




### Cultural issue:
- A cultural issue as well as an accessibility concern is the language barrier. It’s highly likely that there will be users of our app that don’t speak English and it’s our responsibility at Bestnotes to determine where language/cultural differences can be accomodated. To eradicate this cultural issue, we have created a future enhancement that will accommodate a diversity of users worldwide.

### Safety issues:- Although Bestnotes is a harmless note-taking app, there are safety issues regarding this app. The safety issues are:
Criminal organisations/entities using our note-taking app to plan their agendas. 
Our app getting hacked may also be a safety issue as it would expose the data our uses collected to those who may harm them.
A few solutions on how we could deal with these safety issues are:
By monitoring our users and/or writing a disclaimer notice at the start of our app.
It’s impossible to create a 100% hack-proof app because any app is hackable when given the amount of time and resources. However, certain methods we can implement to lessen our chances of getting hacked are:
Use a password manager
Use a two-factor authentication process
Protect our network, laptops/computers and our codes.


Possible social, political, racial, gender and international issues:
Although Bestnotes is a harmless note-taking app, it’s well within our interests to protect our users from the social issues regarding our app. These social issues are: 
The Safety, security and well-being of our users. 
Racial issues/ Racism
Anything that negatively affects our user within our app.
Political and religious extremism
Gender issues
International issues

Social Issues:-
The safety, security and well-being of our users is one of our biggest priorities. At Bestnotes, we intend to deal with this issue by:
Protecting the personal details of our users from potential hackers.
Allowing for a third-party identity provider.
Allowing our users to change their usernames and passwords.
Allowing our users to delete their accounts.
Using a two-step verification.

Political and International Issues:
At Bestnotes, an international issue we face is the language barrier because our app is only in English. To deal with this issue, we plan to introduce a language feature at the start of our app which allows a diversity of users to use our app. Furthermore, we are a neutral app and as such, we partake in no political agendas. In the event that governments use our note-taking app to plan their agendas, we’ll make sure that their notes are protected from potential hackers and we’ll monitor them to make sure that they abide by the law. 
Another future enhancement we plan to implement to deal with this issue is a disclaimer notice which states that we do not agree and/or disagree with the contents of the notes of the user.

Racial Issues and Gender Issues:-
It is our responsibility at Bestnotes to deal with the racial and gender by our users. Racism and gender issues are problems that affect millions of people worldwide. One of our future enhancements may end up resulting in racism and gender issues for those that use it inappropriately. This future enhancement is when multiple users are able to share notes as well as edit/delete one another’s notes and/or categories. In the event that this future enhancement results in racism and gender issues, we plan to deal with these issues by implementing a report option. This report option allows the user to report offensive content and explain their concerns to us at Bestnotes and we will implement effective methods such as deletion of account and police involvement if one or more users are found guilty.




Details of Designing and Planning Process
Evidence of app idea brainstorming sessions:-			
On Wednesday the 17th of April, 2019, we were assigned into groups of two in order to create an app using Ruby and VS Code. Louis and I were grouped together. On this day, we started planning on what app we would like to create. We had a number of options such as: Restaurant, Swimming Pool and Note-taking app.

On Wednesday the 17th of April, we then chose the idea of a note-taking app an we started drawing diagrams of what how we should code it and/or implement it.

Project Plan/ Timeline
After choosing the app idea, we came up with a project plan/timeline of what we hand-wrote what we would like to achieve every day we worked on this assessment. 
![brainstorming](docs/Brainstorming.jpg)

### Description of overall app design (classes, files, basic flow)

Original UML Diagram:
![original uml](docs/originalUML.png)
With each Category being stored in an array in the main code.

Original flowchart
![original flowchart](docs/origFlow.png)

Updated UML
![updated uml](docs/updateUML.png)

We had to update the structure of my classes as we began writing them in code because it became clearer that there was a better way to structure methods in order to enable better readability, and improve debugging and future expansions.

The above flowchart is mostly accurate to how the MVP ended up operating. However we have now also added a login, where a user must be logged in before the flowchart starting at the category menu is initiated. Each user is stored in an array loaded/saved at the beginning and end of each session from a YAML file.

### Design considerations and choices
The app was designed to minimize technical debt and ensure maximum accessibility by any future open source contributors. With this in mind, we decided to split the program into a number of classes, where notes are contained within a category, and categories are contained within users.

A particular instance of User is selected, and all operations on the contained categories are carried out within the scope of that instance. This helps to prevent changes being made to the wrong users categories. The same goes for notes within categories. By having all of the code for editing notes executed within the scope of the particular category, we avoid bugs where notes are added to the wrong category.

Sectioning the code into classes like this also generally makes it more modular, which should make it easier to accept changes from open source contributors as we can be more certain about whether it will introduce bugs or not, or if they do occur more easily determine from where. 

Additionally, we tried to make methods throughout our application as small as possible to make them more easily tested.

While some of the functionality within the classes was similar, we did not use a superclass/subclass structure for a couple of reasons. Firstly, they were not actually different types of the same thing. So, structuring our code in this way could make it difficult to read. Also, because they are not different types of the same thing, while the underlying data structures contained within the two are very similar, the dialogues and data  contained within them are different so by separating them into different classes it is easier to read and understand, and therefore easier to expand on and for other developers to contribute to.
